Features Ideas
--------------

- Debug and try to reduce time between mouseup and first draw
- Detect insufficient depth by analysing number of points escaping on the last available iteration
- Cache scaled divergence values for faster re-colouring
- Save image
- Subtle info button to launch ui / also 'h' and 'F1' hotkeys
- Generate link to current state (possibly maintain)
- Use all physical pixels on devices with devicePixelRatio > 1 (e.g. retina displays)
- Colour scheme editor
    - Click to set reference value
    - Use colour picker to change colour of key values
    - Insert/delete key values
    - Scale contraction/expansion around reference value
    - Hue rotation
    - Set colour palette/guide for randomly generated schemes
    - Allow generating blank schemes for editing
- Block caching
    - Specialized caching for black-only blocks, including hard-coded ones for rendering the start-up screen
    - Translation (moving without zoom) uses existing blocks and only re-calculates new areas
    - Background speculative calculation
    - When increasing depth, only recalculate black points
- Optional connection to C++ calculation module requiring installer
- Arbitrary precision support
- Support for alternative algorithms to z -> z^2 + c
    - z -> z^n + c (takes parameter n)
    - Jump to/from julia set
    - Arbitrary slices of 4D mandel-julia space
    - Convergence behaviour of Newton's method in complex space
- Web workers
- Slave tabs
- Shared sessions with P2P webrtc networking
- Rotation
- Use canvas transforms to animate drag/zoom
- Calculate new blocks during drag
- Colouring options for points inside mandelbrot set
- Possible improvements to technique for assigning sub-iteration values
- Generate larger or specific resolution/aspect ratio images
- Automated facebook/etc sharing options
- Start with lower resolution when recalculating
- Changes to make usable on mobile, e.g. multi-touch zoom/translation/rotation
- Speed up calculation with vector processing via float64 arrays
- Calculation via WebGL
